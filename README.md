# Project: Restaurant Reviews - Stage 1
This app was created as part of the Udacity "Front-End Web Developer" Nanodegree Program.


For this project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
I added accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### How to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:zuckerwar/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
```

2. In the root folder, use Python to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
